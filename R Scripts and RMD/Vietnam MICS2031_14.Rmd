# Introduction

This HTML notebook will replicate the STATA do file named __vnm_mics14_dp2019 for distribution__ in R. The goal is to create an R script that does what the said do file does.

I will follow the same section numbering as in the do file for ease of comparision.

# Libraries

Before we go into the excercise, following are the packages from which we will use various functions.

```{r Libraries}
library(here)
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(haven)
library(gt)
library(readr)
library(magrittr)
```

# Building a Well-Being Index from Vietnam MICS 2013-14

The memory and environment clearing commands and the commands for setting working folders and paths are not needed if one is working in Project mode through RStudio and uses the {here} (read as package here). This is a library for managing paths and directories.

# Vietnam MICS 2014

## Step 1: Data Preparation

__ Selecting main variables from CH, WM, HH & MN recode & merging with HL recode __

It should be noted that anthropometric data was not collected for children under 5 as part of the Viet Nam MICS 2014 dataset. Previously, nutrition data was collected as part of Viet Nam MICS 2011. However, the data was not collected in this round due to time and resource constraints as well as the availability of national nutrition survey data (p.61)

_Above comments are copied from the STATA do file_

### Step 1.1: CH - Children's Recode (Under 5)

According to the STATA do file there is no data for this section.

### Step 1.2: BH - Birth Recode (All females 15-49 years who ever gave birth)

The purpose of step 1.2 is to identify children of any age who died in the last 5 years prior to the survey date. _As seen in the STATA file_

Loading the data from bh.sav.

```{r load_bh}
bh_dat <- read_sav(file = here("Viet Nam_MICS5_Datasets",
                     "Viet Nam MICS 2013-14 SPSS Datasets",
                     "bh.sav"))

bh_dat <- clean_names(bh_dat)
```

The above code chunk loads the bh.sav and names it bh_dat(a data object). The clean names function gets all the variable names in lower snake case. IN case if anyone is wondering what are all the possible cases, please refere to the wonderful art by Allison Horst shown below.

![Various Cases (Let me know your favourite)](coding_cases.png)

Now let us take a glimplse at the data and names of the variables.

```{r varnames}
names(bh_dat)
```

```{r peek}
head(bh_dat) %>% gt()
```

Now let us create variables, only those that are non grouped, i.e. those generated without using _bysort_. In R one can create grouped varibales in a different manner. Will show that in the code chunk following this one.

Before moving forward, please note that, a large part of coding involved in creating this index is a data wrangling process. The tidyverse way of carrying out data wrangling extensively employs {dplyr} (read as 'package dplyr') and its mutate function. Here is a visual cue (created by Allison Horst) to what the mutate function does.

![Wrangling and adding columns](dplyr_mutate.png)

```{r bh_newvars}
bh_dat <- bh_dat %>% 
  mutate(
    ind_id = structure(((hh1*100000)+(hh2*100)+ln),
                       label = "Individual ID"),
    date_death = structure(bh4c + bh9c, 
                           label = "Date of Death CMC"),
    mdead_survey = structure(ifelse(((bh9c == 0 |is.na(bh9c)) & bh5 == 1),
                                     NA, 
                                     wdoi - date_death), 
                             label = "Months Dead from Survey"),
    ydead_survey = structure(mdead_survey/12, 
                             label = "Years dead from Survey"),
    age_death = structure(ifelse(bh5 == 2, bh9c, NA),
                          label = "Age at death in Months"),
    child_died = structure(forcats::as_factor(
      ifelse(is.na(bh5),NA,
             ifelse(bh5==1,"child is alive","child is dead")))),
    child18_died = forcats::as_factor(
      ifelse((!is.na(age_death) & age_death > 216),
             ifelse(is.na(bh5),NA,
                    ifelse(bh5==1,
                           "child is alive",
                           "child is dead")), 
             "child is alive"))
    )
```

Creating Tables for new variables check.

```{r table age_death}
bh_dat %>% 
  tabyl(age_death,show_na = TRUE) %>% 
  gt()
```


```{r bh5 child_died}
bh_dat %>% 
  tabyl(bh5, child_died, show_na = T) %>% 
  gt()
```

```{r tab child18_died}
bh_dat %>% 
  tabyl(child18_died, show_na = T) %>% 
  gt()
```

Creating grouped variables.

Notice that I need not write equivalent R code for the following STATA code chunks:


1> _This has been included in the grouped condition for the variable_

replace tot_child18_died_5y=. if child18_died==1 & ydead_survey==. //Replace as '.' if there is no information on when the child died  

2> _This need not be written as the structure of data is different, only one rwo exists per ind_id_ __NOte that due to this feature there is no need to create "child18u_died_per_wom_5y" as it is same as "tot_child18_died_5y"__

bysort ind_id: egen childu18_died_per_wom_5y = max(tot_child18_died_5y) 
lab var childu18_died_per_wom_5y "Total child under 18 death for each women in the last 5 years (birth recode)"

3> _This need not be written as the structure of data is different, only one rwo exists per ind_id_

//Keep one observation per women 
bysort ind_id: gen id=1 if _n==1 keep if id==1 drop id duplicates report ind_id

```{r bh_newvars_grouped}
bh_dat %>% 
  group_by(ind_id) %>% 
  summarise(
    tot_child_died = sum(child_died == "child is dead", na.rm = T),
    tot_child18_died_5y = sum(
      child18_died[ydead_survey <= 5 & !is.na(ydead_survey)] == "child is dead", na.rm = T),
    women_BH = 1
) %>% 
  mutate(
    tot_child18_died_5y = ifelse(
      (is.na(tot_child18_died_5y) & tot_child_died>=0 & !is.na(tot_child_died)),0,tot_child18_died_5y)
  )-> grouped_bh_dat
```


Creating variables for new grouped variables

```{r tot_child_died tot_chil18_died_5y}
grouped_bh_dat %>% 
  tabyl(tot_child_died, tot_child18_died_5y, show_na = T)
```

Writing new files.

```{r write}
write_csv(bh_dat, here("output data files","1.2Intermediate_VNM14_BH.csv"))
write_csv(grouped_bh_dat,here("output data files","1.2VNM14_BH.csv")) # same as VNM14_BH.dta
```

### Step 1.3: WM - Women's Record (All eligible females 15-49 in the household)

Loading data and setting case for variable (column) names.

```{r load_wm}
wm_dat <- read_sav(file = here("Viet Nam_MICS5_Datasets",
                     "Viet Nam MICS 2013-14 SPSS Datasets",
                     "wm.sav"))

wm_dat <- clean_names(wm_dat)
```

Mutating the data for creating new variables. This is what one would refere to generating new varibles in STATA, I think.

Note, for the varible marital or marital_wom, I miss to see whyn the STATA code defines it as marital to begin with and renames it to marital_wom. I will define this varibale as marital_wom from the begining itself. Kindly bring to notice if this is incorrect.

```{r wm_newvar}
wm_dat <- wm_dat %>% 
  mutate(
    ind_id = structure(((hh1*100000)+(hh2*100)+ln),
                       label = "Individual ID"),
    women_wm = 1,
    marital_wom = structure(
      forcats::as_factor(
      case_when(
        mstatus == 3 & is.na(ma6) ~ "Never Married",
        mstatus == 1 & is.na(ma6) ~ "Currently Married",
        mstatus == 2 & ma6 == 1 ~ "Widowed",
        mstatus == 2 & ma6 == 2 ~ "Divorced",
        mstatus == 2 & ma6 == 3 ~ "Seperated/Not living together",
      )
    ), label = "Marital Status of Household Member"
  )
) 

```

While creating new variables the STATA code has various tables. I will generate those here.

```{r unique ind_id}
length(unique(wm_dat$ind_id)) == nrow(wm_dat)
```

This means all Individual Ids are unique, i.e., every row represents a unique individual.

```{r cm1_cm8, warning=FALSE}
wm_dat %>% 
  tabyl(cm1, cm8,show_na = TRUE) %>% 
  gt()
```

```{r mstat_ma6}
head(wm_dat[,c("mstatus","ma6")],10)
```

```{r tab_mstat_ma6, warning=FALSE}
wm_dat %>% 
  tabyl(mstatus, ma6,show_na = TRUE) %>% 
  gt()

```

```{r marital_miss_tab}
wm_dat %>% 
  tabyl(marital_wom, show_na = TRUE) %>% 
  gt()
```

```{r ma6_marital, warning=FALSE}
wm_dat %>% 
  tabyl(ma6, marital_wom, show_na = TRUE) %>% 
  gt()
```

```{r mstatus_marital, warning=FALSE}
wm_dat %>% 
  tabyl(mstatus, marital_wom, show_na = TRUE) %>% 
  gt()
```

Keeping relevant columns.

```{r keeping cols}
wm_dat <- wm_dat%>% 
  select(wm7, cm1, cm8, cm9a, cm9b, 
         ind_id, women_wm, dplyr::ends_with("_wom"))
```

Writing the tables in csv.

```{r write_wm}
write_csv(wm_dat,here("output data files","1.3VNM14_WM.csv"))
```

### Step 1.4: MR - MEn's Recode (All eligible men in the household)

__As mentioned in the STATA code__, Note: There is no male recode file for Viet Nam MICS 2014. Hence the commands under this section have been remove

### Step 1.5 HH - Household Record (All Households intereviewed)

Load data.

```{r load_HH}
hh_dat <- read_sav(file = here("Viet Nam_MICS5_Datasets",
                     "Viet Nam MICS 2013-14 SPSS Datasets",
                     "hh.sav"))

hh_dat <- clean_names(hh_dat)
```

Creating new variables.

```{r newvars_hh}
hh_dat <- hh_dat %>% 
  mutate(
    hh_id = structure((hh1*100 + hh2), label = "Household ID")
  )
```
 
write data in csv.

```{r write_hh}
write_csv(hh_dat,here("output data files","1.5VNM14_HH.csv"))
```

### step 1.6: HL - Household Member

Load data.

```{r hl_load}
hl_dat <- read_sav(file = here("Viet Nam_MICS5_Datasets",
                     "Viet Nam MICS 2013-14 SPSS Datasets",
                     "hl.sav"))

hl_dat <- clean_names(hl_dat)
```

Creating new variables.

```{r hl_newvars}
hl_dat %>% 
  mutate(
    hh_id = structure(
      (hh1*100) + hh2,
      label = "Household ID"
    ),
    ind_id = structure(
      (hh1 * 100000) + (hh2 * 100) + hl1,
      label  = "Individual ID"
    )
  ) -> hl_dat
```

### Step 1.7: Data Merging

Unlike the STATA code the merging here will look a little different. It will be in a single flow. However, checks will be shown prior to mrunnig the merge command.

```{r merge_hl7 check, warning=FALSE}
hl_dat %>% 
  left_join(grouped_bh_dat, by = c("ind_id" = "ind_id")) %>% 
  left_join(wm_dat, by = c("ind_id" = "ind_id")) %>%
  tabyl(hl7, show_na = T)
```

```{r wm temp check, warning=FALSE}
hl_dat %>% 
  left_join(grouped_bh_dat, by = c("ind_id" = "ind_id")) %>% 
  left_join(wm_dat, by = c("ind_id" = "ind_id")) %>%
  mutate(temp = hl7 > 0) %>% 
  tabyl(women_wm, temp, show_na = T)
```

```{r wm7 check, warning=FALSE}
hl_dat %>% 
  left_join(grouped_bh_dat, by = c("ind_id" = "ind_id")) %>% 
  left_join(wm_dat, by = c("ind_id" = "ind_id")) %>%
  mutate(temp = hl7 > 0) %>% 
  filter((temp == 1 & is.na(women_wm))) %>% 
  tabyl(wm7, show_na = T)
```

```{r hhdat merge ,warning=FALSE}
hl_dat %>% 
  left_join(grouped_bh_dat, by = c("ind_id" = "ind_id")) %>% 
  left_join(wm_dat, by = c("ind_id" = "ind_id")) %>%
  left_join(hh_dat, by = c("hh_id" = "hh_id")) %>% 
  filter(hh9 ==1) %>% # keeping only households that completed interview
  mutate(
    marital_men = structure(NA, label = "Marital Status of household member")
  ) -> merged_dat
```

Writing this object for safe keeping.

```{r write_mereged data}
write_csv(merged_dat,here("output data files","1.7VNM14_merged.csv"))
```

### Step 1.8: Control Variables

Comments from the STATA code:

_Households are identified as having 'no eligible' members if there are no applicable population, that is, children 0-5 years, adult women 15-49 years or adult men. These households will not have information on relevant indicators of health. As such, these households are considered as non-deprived in those relevant indicators._

As one must have noticed from previous sections, I prefer not to gererate variables that are grouped _in the same data frame_. However, in the following sections I will follow as the code in STATA do file. This is because the code seems to mutate the same data frame starting from section __Step 1.6__.

Having said this, I should explain why I am averse to this practice. Consider the following example.

```{r example averse group}
tibble::tibble(
  a = c(1,2,3,4,5,6),
  b= rep(letters[1:3],2)
) -> data_example ## data for illustration

data_example
```

Say, we want sum of column a for each type of observation in column b. We shall name this new variable c.

```{r ex mutate}
data_example %>% 
  group_by(b) %>% 
  mutate(
    c = sum(a)
  )
  
```

Above is the output we would generate if we wanted a sum of 'a' grouped by 'b'. This might end up being misleading to someone who has neve seen the code but want to use the data. Some might do a simple average of cloumn c or try other summary statistics over this new column. 

Moving on.

#### No Eligible Women 15-49 years

```{r no eligble women1}
merged_dat %>% 
  mutate(
    fem_eligible = ifelse(hl7 > 0 & !is.na(hl7), TRUE, NA), ## if hl7 is greater than 0, it cannot be NA, but I will stick to the STATA code for now

### Step 2.1: Years of Schooling

Comments from the STATA Code:

_Note: In Viet Nam, children enter primary school aged 6 years, enter lower secondary school at 11 and upper secondary school at 15. There are grades in primary school (Grades 1 to 5), four in lower secondary school (Grades 6 to 9) and three in upper secondary school (Grades 10 to 12).(pg 192 report)_

Let us first save the data frame created in the environment. This way we reduce the length of the code and copy pasting it again and again.

```{r save merge}

  ) -> merged_dat

```

Table ed4b ed4a 

```{r tab ed4b ed4a}
merged_dat %>% 
  tabyl(ed4b, ed4a, show_na = T) %>% 
  kableExtra::kable()
```

Table age ed6a when ed5 is 1

```{r tab age ed6a}
merged_dat %>% 
  filter(ed5 == 1) %>% 
  tabyl(age, ed6a, show_na = T) %>% 
  kableExtra::kable()
```

Creating edulevel and table ed4a, ed3

```{r edulevel mutate}
merged_dat %>% 
  mutate(
    edulevel = ifelse(ed4a >= 8, NA, ed4a),
    edulevel = ifelse((is.na(ed3) | ed3 == 2),0,edulevel)
  ) %>% 
  tabyl(ed4a, ed3, show_na = T) %>% 
  gt() 
```

Creating eduhighyear and table ed4b, ed43

```{r eduhihgyear mutate}
merged_dat %>% 
  mutate(
    edulevel = ifelse(ed4a >= 8, NA, ed4a),
    edulevel = ifelse((is.na(ed3) | ed3 == 2),0,edulevel),
    eduhighyear = ifelse((is.na(ed4b)|ed4b == 97| ed4b == 98| ed4b == 99),
                         NA, ed4b),
    eduhighyear = ifelse((is.na(ed3) | ed3 == 2),0,eduhighyear)
  ) %>% 
  tabyl(ed4b, ed3, show_na = T) %>% 
  gt()
```

Now, I feel it is as good a time as any, since we have moved this forward in to mutating new variables, to introduce the {magrittr} pipes. Up till now in the document you must have seen %>% appear everywhere. This is a pipe operator. What it does is to allow us to write code where the format is similar to f(g(y(x))), where f,g, and y are function, and x is input for y and y(x) is input of g and so on.

One must have noticed that if I am mutating multiple varibables of a data frame I ahve to reassign the mutated data frame with -> or <- operator. This can be redundant at times. Consider the following example.

```{r example pipe}
tibble(
  a = c(1,2,3,4),
  b = c(11,22,11,11)
) -> ex_pipe
```

let us say I want a new variable c = a*b in the same data frame ex_pipe and keep rows where b is 11. Below is code to do it with using pipe operator.

```{r expipe1}
ex_pipe %>% 
  mutate(
    c= a * b # creating new variable
  ) %>%  # using pipe to feed the output of mutate in to filter function
  filter(
    b == 11
  ) -> ex_pipe # updating the ex_pipe object/ data frame by reassigning.

ex_pipe
```

I might not want to use -> operator as it can get redundant. There is a cousin of the %>%  operator that helps us tackle this problem. For instance, say i want ot add 1 to c in each row and update the data prame ex_pipe.

```{r expipe2}
ex_pipe %<>% ## Notice the difference
  mutate(
    c = c+1
  ) ##notice no need for arrow opration and reassignment 

ex_pipe
```

We will be using %<>% where necessary.

Ok. Back on track now.

updating merged_dat.

```{r update mutate}
merged_dat %<>% 
  mutate(
    edulevel = ifelse(ed4a >= 8, NA, ed4a),
    edulevel = ifelse((is.na(ed3) | ed3 == 2),0,edulevel),

                         NA, ed4b),
    eduhighyear = structure(ifelse((is.na(ed3) | ed3 == 2),0,eduhighyear), 
                            label = "HIghest year of education completed")

__Notice there is a deviation from STATA code : replace no_missing_aten = no_missing_atten/hhs. This is because when both variables are 0 NaNs are generated.__
